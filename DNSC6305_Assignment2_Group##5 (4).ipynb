    "We would try to update the constraint from \"NOT NULL\" to \"NULL\" and upload the data. The reason we take that approach is because when studying the data we found the \"fy\" field gives the fiscal year in focus. There already exists fields for fiscal year end date \"fye\" which gives the months and the balance sheet date \"period\" which gives the year month and date. It seems like making the field constraint null may not effect our analysis for the dataset. These values cannot be dropped since there are more missing fields in this column than filled in fields."

    "Normally, we’d try to find and fill in these missing values, but we don't have enough information from the documentation or the sponsor. However, since \"plabel\" is a string and mainly adds extra detail to each tag in the PRE table, it doesn't seem crucial for calculations, especially because the \"tag\" field itself is not null. This means that even if \"plabel\" is missing, we can still get the necessary information from \"tag.\" Given that there are only 270 missing values in a large dataset, we decided to leave them as is by dropping the NULL constraint on it to load the data."

    "This question asks to identify and rank the most common tags associated with companies in the Finance and Insurance sector (SIC codes 6021-6411). We filter for companies in the finance sector and ensures each has a relevant tag in the NUM table. By retrieving each tag's ID, label (name), and counting distinct companies (cik) linked to each tag, the query provides the number of unique companies associated with each tag. Grouping by tag ID and label, it then orders the results by the company count in descending order, highlighting the most frequently associated tags in this sector at the top of the list."

The query we use joins the SUB, NUM, and TAG tables to access company details, asset values, and tags, then calculates total assets by summing values where the tag has \"Assets\" in it. We group it by company name and sector. The query then orders results by total assets in descending order and limits the output to the top 5 companies."
